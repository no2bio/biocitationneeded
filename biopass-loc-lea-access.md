##### Biometric passport data retention

Accroding to the US [Library of Congress](https://archive.today/oNlGC), biometric data collected for production of passports is also retained and may be used by law enforcement agencies in
[Argentina](country-ar.html),
[Australia](country-au.html),
[Brazil](country-br.html),
[France](country-fr.html),
[Israel](country-il.html),
[New Zealand](country-nz.html),
[Ukraine](country-ua.html),
and the [USA](country-us.html).

This may &mdash; of course &mdash; gradually create creeping de-facto databases of a large part of the population (citizens who travel).

This practice is **prohibited by law** in
[Germany](country-de.html), [Sweden](country-se.html), and [South Korea](country-kr.html).
