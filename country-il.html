      <p><p><p>The Wikipedia entry <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometric_Database_Law">Biometric Databese Law</a>
deals with the Israeli law that might soon force all citizens to submit their biometric information
(2 fingerprints and a biometric facial photo) to a database.</p>

<p>You can read more about it <a href="http://english.no2bio.org">here</a>.</p>

          <p><p><p>According to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometric_passport#Countries_using_biometric_passports">Wikipedia</a>,
citizens of <em>Israel</em> can/must have biometric passports [doesn't imply retaining biometric information].</p>
</p>
<p>Having said that, citizens who refuse to volunteer for the biometric database pilot are forced to issue an easy to forge paper passport, and are charged a fee of <em>???</em> (which is waived for those who volunteer)<sup><em>[citation needed]</em></sup>.</p></p>

          <p><p><p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countries_applying_biometrics">wikipedia</a>,
<a href="country-gm.html">Gambia</a> and <a href="country-iq.html">Iraq</a> seem to have compulsory
biometric databases for all citizens (for some reason, <a href="country-pk.html">Pakistan</a>
isn't mentioned on that page).
In <a href="country-im.html">India</a> it is <a href="https://archive.today/pSsGO">not compulsory</a>, and
in <a href="country-il.html">Israel</a> &mdash; it's considered to be at a "pilot" stage, so
citizens can still refuse to submit their biometric data.</p>
