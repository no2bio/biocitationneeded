<p>The national ID was <a href="https://archive.today/56VM0">abolished</a> in the 50s by Churchill.
During the early 21<sup>st</sup> century, there was a failed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_Cards_Act_2006">attempt</a> to reinstate one. See also <a href="http://www.no2id.net/">No2ID.net</a>.</p></p>
