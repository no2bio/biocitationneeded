Pakistan's *National Database and Registration Authority* ([NARDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Database_and_Registration_Authority#cite_note-National_Database_and_Registry_Authority-1)) is responsible for issuing the computerized national identity cards to the citizens of Pakistan.
It [claims](https://archive.today/KiPAy)
to hold the record for maintaining the largest biometric database of citizens in the world.

Strange, but [India](country-in.html) also [claims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countries_applying_biometrics#India) that ;)

It seems like this is a compulsory database for all citizens *[citation needed]*.
