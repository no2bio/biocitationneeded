The [Indonesian identity card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_identity_card) wikipedia entry says:
*Fingerprints are recorded from each compulsory ID cards are all fingers
(of ten), but the data included in the chip only two fingers, the thumb and right index finger.*

Since they record more information than they store on the card, this implies
a biometric database.

* [Biometric Update, November 28, 2012](https://archive.today/jEocB#selection-943.42-943.155):

  *e-KTP obligates every citizen to have his or her fingerprints scanned,
  verified, and saved in a central database.*
