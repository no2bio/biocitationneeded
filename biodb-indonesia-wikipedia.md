The [Indonesian identity card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_identity_card) wikipedia entry says:
*Fingerprints are recorded from each compulsory ID cards are all fingers
(of ten), but the data included in the chip only two fingers, the thumb and right index finger.*

Since they record more information than they store on the card, this *most probably* implies
a biometric database.
