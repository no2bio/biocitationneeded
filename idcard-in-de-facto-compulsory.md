  *In making Aadhaar mandatory for filing taxes and securing core taxpayer
   identity, the government has openly gone against a Supreme Court order
   from last year that explicitly stated that the Aadhaar Card scheme is
   "purely voluntary" and cannot be made mandatory until the court has
   decided on this.*

  *Aadhaar's use, by no means, is restricted to government agencies alone.
   A growing number of private financial institutions are now fulfilling
   their "Know Your Customer" or e-KYC formalities by making Aadhaar
   compulsory. The government is also in the process of making Aadhaar
   the basis of all financial transactions.*
