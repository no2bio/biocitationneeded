According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countries_applying_biometrics),
[Gambia](country-gm.html) and [Iraq](country-iq.html) seem to have compulsory
biometric databases for all citizens (This is only a **parial** list. For example: [Pakistan](country-pk.html)
isn't mentioned).
In [India](country-im.html) it is [not compulsory](https://archive.today/pSsGO), and
in [Israel](country-il.html) &mdash; it's considered to be at a "pilot" stage, so
citizens can still refuse to submit their biometric data.
